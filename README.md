# Churn-prediction-using-ANN

Churn prediction aims to detect customers intended to leave a service provider.Here the prediction is done on bank customers.This modelling enables the companies or organisations to identify the areas where they lag behind, thereby enabling them to rectify those issues and also aid in increasing the retention rate. The machine learning technique used in this project is Artificial Neural Network.

This project is based on a bank dataset where I analyzed each variable to understand why customers are leaving.

## Result
Model that is built gives the training accuracy of 85% and a testing accuracy score of 85%
